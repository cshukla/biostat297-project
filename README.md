We have divided the project in 2 parts - lincRNA-miRNA interactions and lincRNA-RBP interactions and hence the 2 main directories. Each main directory has 4 sub folders - bin, data, literature and results. Here’s a short description of each:

bin - stores all the scripts we used for that project [mostly Python/R]
data - stores the data we started from for that project [RNA Compete/ TargetScanS/ GENCODE]
literature - A few papers or reviews to help us get an overview of what we’re doing
results - The results we get when we run our scripts from bin on the data

We have provided all the scripts here. To get access to the raw data and literature, please e-mail me at ```cshukla at g dot harvard dot edu```.
