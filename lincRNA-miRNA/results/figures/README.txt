"Representative_miRNA1_m8andt1A_lincRNAhit.png"

This file shows a representative perfect seed match + m8 + t1A for the miR1 family in a lincRNA.  This image was generated by aligning the miR1 hit with the selected lincRNA using Clustal Omega.

This file shows the breakdown of the number of hits for 5 different miRNA families.  As shown in the image, the number of lincRNA hits changes depending on the seed variation used.  There is not necessarily a general pattern of change, indicating that requiring a perfect match (m8) at position 8 or an "A" at the t1 position (t1A) affects the number of hits for each miRNA family in a different way.

This is a graphical overview of the total number of miRNA hits in lincRNAs for each miRNA seed variation.
